This chapter will show you how you can easily use Istio to control the flow of traffic and API calls between services. 

Istio simplifies configuration of service-level properties like circuit breakers, timeouts, and retries, and makes it easy to set up important tasks like A/B testing, canary rollouts, and staged rollouts with percentage-based traffic splits.

You will understand the following topics by the end of this chapter.
* How to expose a service with ISTIO Ingress Gateway?
* How to set up HTTP path Condition Routing?
* How to set up Traffic Splitting (Canary, weight-based routing)?
* How Identity-Based Routing works. 
* How to Build resilient microservice applications using circuit breaking?
* How to enables introducing new features/changes into production with the least amount of risk using Istio Mirroring capability?
